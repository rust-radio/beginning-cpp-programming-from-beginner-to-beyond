# C++11

**ChatGPT:** C++11 is the version of the C++ programming language that was released in 2011. It is a major update to the language, introducing many new features and improvements to the standard library.

Some of the key features introduced in C++11 include:

1. **Automatic type inference**: The auto keyword can be used to automatically deduce the type of a variable from its initializer.

2. **Lambda expressions**: A concise way to define anonymous functions inline.

3. **Range-based for loop**: A new loop syntax that allows iterating over a range of elements in a container.

4. **Uniform initialization syntax**: A consistent syntax for initializing variables using braces {}.

5. **Rvalue references and move semantics**: A mechanism for efficiently moving objects rather than copying them.

6. **Smart pointers**: New pointer types that provide automatic memory management and avoid common memory-related issues.

7. **Concurrency support**: A new standard library for working with threads and parallel programming.

8. **Variadic templates**: Templates that can accept a variable number of arguments, enabling more flexible and reusable code.

9. **Regular expressions**: A new standard library for working with regular expressions.

10. **Static assertions**: A mechanism for testing compile-time conditions and generating compiler errors if they are not met.

Overall, C++11 introduced many new features that make the language more expressive, safer, and easier to use. It has become the new baseline for modern C++ programming, and subsequent versions of the language have built upon the features introduced in C++11.
